## Overview :airplane:
This is the source code for a workshop hosted by the [UVic Web Development Club](https://www.facebook.com/UVicWebDev/), originally prepared by Juan Carlos Gallegos (@okjuan).

At a high-level, our app is composed of a Python server and a JS/HTML/CSS client. The workshop is divided into several parts that build on each other incrementally; throughout, we make use the Spotify and Dialogflow APIs to develop our app's functionality.
* Part 1: We search Spotify via an API call to find music based on user input.
* Part 2: We query a Dialogflow agent via an API call for processing a user's natural language input.
* Part 3: We configure our Dialogflow agent to make a request to our own Python server for additional information.
* Part 4: We create a new endpoint on our Python server to serve our Dialogflow's agent request.

### Part :one:
Your starting point:
* A minimal web client containing a Spotify widget and a minimal Python server.
    * The given server is meant to run (locally) and serves a *Spotify bearer token*
    * The client fetches the bearer token from the server, which it needs to make requests to the Spotify Web API

:bulb: **Your task:** :bulb:
* Make an HTTP GET request to the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to get the Spotify URI for the song entered by the user
